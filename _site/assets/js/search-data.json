Packets addresses to a unicast address will be delivered to a specific network interface. | global unicast - similar to IPv4 public IP addresses. These addresses are assigned by the IANA and used on public networks. | unique local - similar to IPv4 private address. They are used in private networks and aren’t routable on the Internet. They start with FC or FD. | link local - these addresses are used for sending packets over the local subnet. Routers do not forward packets with this addresses to other subnets. IPv6 requires a link-local address to be assigned to every network interface on which the IPv6 protocol is enabled. These addresses have a prefix of FE80::/10. | .

IPv6 Address Acquisition DHCP . To find an address with DHCP, the DHCP client sends messages to a DHCP server, and the server assigns a currently unused address in the correct subnet for the endpoint host to use. The proces relies on DHCP client functions in each device and a DHCP server configured and working in the network. ",

Initially, the ISP obtains the IPv6 address from IANA regional registry. Next, they make use of the next 8 bits, after the network prefix to allocate IPv6 addresses. Those addresses then get assigned to their clients. The address assigned to the client then gets further broken down based on the number of networks they need for each region. Since, the first 48 bits is assigned by the ISP (and cannot be changed); the last 16 bits can be used for assigning network addresses to each of the regions. After the networks have been assigned to each region, each address can be further broken down to encompass the cities within those regions. Basic Router Operation . A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between multiple networks. This is a different to a switch, whereby, it only facilities communication within the same network. For example, imagine we would like to send a ping message from our computer to a server on another network. First, after running the command, the ping message gets encapsulated in a packet with the host and destination address. The packet then gets encapsulated into a frame, which is a layer 2 carrier for our packets. It contains the host (PC) and destination (default gateway) MAC address. Once the frame reaches the default gateway, it strips away the frame and encapsulates the packet into a new frame. The new frame has the source MAC address of the 10.0.0.129 interface and a destination MAC address of the server. Once the frame reaches the server, it strips away the frame and packet, determining the ping message. After this, the process happens in reverse for server to send a ping reply back to the PC. ",

Router Password Recovery . Typically, we want to interrupt the router’s boot process when we need to reset the password. To recover the password for Cisco Router we have to follow these steps: . | Shutdown the Router | Power the Router back on and issue the break command | The Router will now go into ROM monitor mode | Issue the command confreg 0x2142 which tells the Router to ignore startup-config | Reset the Router | Elevate to Privilleged mode | copy startup-config running-config | Change password | Go back into configure mode - conf t | Issue the command config-register 0x2102, changing changes the ‘Configuration Register’ back to its original state | copy run start | We need to manually bring up the interfaces, as copying the running config to startup doesn’t do this for us . | show ip interface-brief - displays the statuses of the interfaces | no shutdown - brings the interface back up | . | copy run start | . Troubleshooting Boot Process . The following steps indicate how to go about erasing the flash memory on a Cisco Router. | Authenticate via serial . | RossRouter&gt; en RossRouter# show flash . | RossRouter# erase flash: . | RossRouter# reload . | . If there is no IOS on the flash, the Router will have nothing to boot. To recover the IOS, you have several options depending on the model of the Router. Method 1 . If the Router has a removable flash card, you can remove that card and add files to it manually from a PC. After inserting the IOS on the card, you can insert back into the Router and it will boot the OS. Method 2 . Some models of Routers can use TFTP from ROM monitor mode, meaning you can copy the IOS files remotely. To determine if your router has this functionality, visit cisco.com. Other Options . If you face this situation, the best option is to google for a solution. There should be plenty of options based on your Router’s model. Useful IOS Show Commands . Show IOS version and Configuration Register . RossRouter# show version . Show files on flash registry and available space . RossRouter# show flash . Show state of all the Router’s interfaces . RossRouter# show ip interface brief RossRouter(config)# do show ip interface brief . Show all details about an interface, e.g. MAC address, IP address, MTU, Bandwidth. Particularly useful when you need to investigate issues/erros with the interface. RossRouter# show interface f0/0 . Prevent attempts to establist Telnet connection with supposed domain name entered. This stops your Cisco Router attempting to connect with a device when you have incorrectly typed a command. RossRouter(config)# no ip domain-lookup . ",
