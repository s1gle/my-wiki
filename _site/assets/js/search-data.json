Similar to IPv4, the network portion of the address must be the same for two devices to communicate. IPv6 unicast addresses . Unicast address represents a single interface. Packets addresses to a unicast address will be delivered to a specific network interface. | global unicast - similar to IPv4 public IP addresses. These addresses are assigned by the IANA and used on public networks. | unique local - similar to IPv4 private address. They are used in private networks and aren’t routable on the Internet. They start with FC or FD. | link local - these addresses are used for sending packets over the local subnet. Routers do not forward packets with this addresses to other subnets. IPv6 requires a link-local address to be assigned to every network interface on which the IPv6 protocol is enabled. These addresses have a prefix of FE80::/10. | . How many IPv6 Addresses . 264 = 18,446,744,073,709,600,00 . For EACH IPv6 Network! . IPv6 Address Acquisition SLAAC . IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration or SLAAC allows devices on a network to automatically configure IPv6 addresses on its interface without managing a DHCP server. | Learn the IPv6 prefix used on the link, from any router, using NDP RS/RA messages. | Build an address from the prefix plus an interface ID, chosen either by using EUI-64 rules or as a random value. | Before using the address, first determine that no host is already using the same address. | . IPv6 Address Acquisition DHCP . To find an address with DHCP, the DHCP client sends messages to a DHCP server, and the server assigns a currently unused address in the correct subnet for the endpoint host to use. The proces relies on DHCP client functions in each device and a DHCP server configured and working in the network. ",

Initially, the ISP obtains the IPv6 address from IANA regional registry. Next, they make use of the next 8 bits, after the network prefix to allocate IPv6 addresses. Those addresses then get assigned to their clients. The address assigned to the client then gets further broken down based on the number of networks they need for each region. Since, the first 48 bits is assigned by the ISP (and cannot be changed); the last 16 bits can be used for assigning network addresses to each of the regions. After the networks have been assigned to each region, each address can be further broken down to encompass the cities within those regions. Basic Router Operation . A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between multiple networks. This is a different to a switch, whereby, it only facilities communication within the same network. For example, imagine we would like to send a ping message from our computer to a server on another network. First, after running the command, the ping message gets encapsulated in a packet with the host and destination address. The packet then gets encapsulated into a frame, which is a layer 2 carrier for our packets. It contains the host (PC) and destination (default gateway) MAC address. Once the frame reaches the default gateway, it strips away the frame and encapsulates the packet into a new frame. The new frame has the source MAC address of the 10.0.0.129 interface and a destination MAC address of the server. Once the frame reaches the server, it strips away the frame and packet, determining the ping message. After this, the process happens in reverse for server to send a ping reply back to the PC. ",
